# Doppler Relay PHP Examples

In this repository you will find a series of examples about how to consume Doppler 
Relay services using PHP.

If you use [docker](https://www.docker.com/) you do not need to install nothing else
to run the examples. Simply execute `./build_n_run.sh [example_folder_name]`, for
example `./build_n_run.sh php-smtp-cli-example`. 

These examples are using a Docker image with the prerequisites already installed. If you need more details about these dependencies check [Docker image sources](https://github.com/DopplerRelay/docker-php) and [Docker file](https://github.com/DopplerRelay/docker-php/blob/master/Dockerfile) with the setup steps.
